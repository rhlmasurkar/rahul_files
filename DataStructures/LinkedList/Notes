Notes
LinkedList is queue. FIFO, the data is stored in contiguous memory blocks
there is no separate head Node in  LinkedList. It starts with normal Node.

In order to traverse the LinkedList, the user has to start from the head node,
hence traversal is O(n) in LinkedList.
Insertion is O(1)
Deletion has two steps, first is List traversal and then the node is deleted,
Hence deletion in the LinkedList is O(n).


Doubly LinkedList is used to inplement Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
In this caching mechanism, the data which is recently used is added
at the head of the LinkedList. Hence, in the LinkedList, the data which is at the end is
Least Recently Used.
Initially a threshold is determined , once the LinkedList
reaches the threshold, end of the list is removed. In this way, the List has only that data which is Used
more often thus reducing the querying time .
